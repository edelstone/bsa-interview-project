# BSA interview project summary

For this phase, we're going to work through a workflow that we've had to solve many times at BSA and have plenty of experience with: helping our ad-ops and sales team understand what's available for sale.

This spec is vague: design and code (to the extent you're able to) a way to interact with the blackbox system that is forecasting. We have forecasting data by country and platform across various segments on a day-by-day basis; a typical question we're trying to answer here would be "how much inventory is available in the US for Apr 15 to Apr 30 targeting the photography segment/audience?", and the answer would be something like "400k impressions". Inventory is more generally defined as the number of impressions and clicks that we're estimating to be available for the given criteria.

How you want to implement this workflow is up to you - but Jon and I are here to answer questions and act as a sounding board (you can pretend we're the target user). This project throws you into the deep-end of ad-tech, but we know this is a new world to you, so don't hesitate to bug us for help.

Please provide an estimate for how long this will take you (both in terms of work/hours as well as calendar time, since we know you have other commitments that will interfere), so we know what to expect and to ensure you aren't spending too much time on this.

Have fun!
